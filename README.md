# UCI-Human-Activity-Recognition-Data-Cleaning-Project
UCI HAR dataset is cleaned into a tidy dataset with R.

The code used to clean the data is stored in `run_analysis.R` which first imports all the datasets from `./UCI HAR dataset/` directory and then does different operations as mentioned in `CodeBook.md` to clean the data.

After the cleaning is done, the cleaned data is exported into `Tidy_dataset.txt` and `Averaged_tidy_dataset.txt` files

## Details of Dataset
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
